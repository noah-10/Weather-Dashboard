## Description

- This application allows users to input a city and see the weather forecast for current day and the next five days.

- Allows users to see their most recent searches for future use.

## Functions

- When a user searches for a city they will be able to see the temperature, wind speed and humidity for the current day and the next five days.

- Each day will have a symbol to represent the weather for that day.

- If the user input isn't already on the recent searches then it will then be displayed for recent searches.

- Each input will be saved to local storage, so whenever the user loads up the dashboard their most recent searches will be displayed on recent searches.

- If a city can noot be found then a error message will be displayed and the input will not be stored to local storage and won't be displayed on recent searches.

- Clicking on one of the recent searches will then be displayed on the dashboard.
